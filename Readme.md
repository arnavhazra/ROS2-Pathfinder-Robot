## Project Overview

This project is a ROS2 application that demonstrates a virtual robot navigating autonomously in a 2D grid environment. The robot must move from a starting point to a destination while avoiding obstacles defined in the grid. The project focuses on ROS2, basic pathfinding algorithms, and grid-based modeling.

### Files and Their Purpose

- **grid_environment.py**: This file defines the functions for creating, setting up, and visualizing the 2D grid environment. It includes the `create_grid`, `set_obstacles`, `get_start_and_end`, and `visualize_grid` functions.

- **grid_setup_node.py**: This node initializes the grid, start, and end points, and visualizes the grid. It is responsible for setting up the ROS2 node and executing the grid setup tasks.

- **path_planning_node.py**: This node is responsible for path planning and robot movement. It initializes the grid, start, and end points, defines obstacles, initializes the robot, calculates the path, and visualizes the path.

- **robot.py**: This file defines the `Robot` class, which represents the robot's position, valid moves, moving, and is_valid_move methods.

- **dynamic_obstacle.py** (optional): This file implements the dynamic obstacle feature, which allows obstacles to change position over time. It includes the `DynamicObstacle` class, which updates the obstacle position and speed.

- **gui.py** (optional): This file is a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing the grid and robot movement. It includes the `GridGUI` class, which draws the grid, robot, and obstacles using Tkinter.

- **integration_test.py** (optional): This file tests the ROS2 topic integration by publishing and subscribing to a test topic. It includes the `test_ros2_topics_integration` function, which performs assertions to verify the integration.

- **pathfinding.py** (optional): This file implements the A-star pathfinding algorithm, which calculates the shortest path from the start to the destination while avoiding obstacles. It includes the `a_star` function, which calculates the path, and the `visualize_path` function, which visualizes the path.

- **robot_decision_making.py** (optional): This file implements a simple decision-making algorithm for the robot to choose between multiple paths. It includes the `RobotDecisionMaking` class, which makes decisions based on certain criteria.

### How to Run the Code

1. Set up the ROS2 environment and create a ROS2 package for the project.

2. Add the provided code files (e.g., grid_environment.py, grid_setup_node.py, path_planning_node.py, robot.py) to the appropriate directories within the ROS2 package.

3. Build the ROS2 package using colcon. Navigate to the root of your workspace and run the following command:

   ```bash
   colcon build --packages-select your_package_name
   ```

4. Run the individual nodes using the `ros2 run` command. For example, to run the `grid_setup_node.py`, you can use:

   ```bash
   ros2 run your_package_name grid_setup_node
   ```

5. Check the functionality of each node. For instance, you can verify the grid visualization in the `grid_setup_node` and the path visualization in the `path_planning_node`.

6. Future steps: run integration tests and the GUI to further validate the behavior of the ROS2 application.
